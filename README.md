# cmpt-221-group
Group project designing a tech checkout system that would function at Marist College. The system will be used by people with different levels of authentication such as students, student workers, faculty, department heads, and administrators. Using this program students and faculty will be able to look at the devices they have checked out to them and update the status of the device if theirs breaks, student workers can assign devices to the system and to students that need new devices, faculty can be given devices by their department head, and admins can access all of the data in the system, change the structure and layout of the database as well as the features in the UI, and perform maintenance as needed.
