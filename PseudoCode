Another way to do the roles and their unique pages is having an identifier like the role be compared at the login page.
This could then be redirected to the proper page for each role instead of having a seperate @app.route for each.
Pseudo Code is as follows:

Form:
    Login
        Require Username and Password
        Validation of Login
        If validaton == pass
            Comparison of roles through database
                Matching of Roles
                    If Role == Student
                        return redirect('/student/dashboard')
                    Else Role == etc.
                        return redirect('/etc/dashboard')
        Else
            Send error message to redo login

We can do that for all the others and keep the templates already created.
